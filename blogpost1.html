    </header>
    <p>I have learned that there is <strong>SO MUCH MORE</strong> to web marketing than I thought beforehand. The amount
        of research done doesn't surprise <br>me all that much but at the same time, it is a lot more time consuming
        than I thought it would be.</p>
    <p>I am stressed out for the made up group so I don't know what will happen to my business once I start creating it.
    </p>
    <p>I definitely believe that before making a product, you have to be passionate about it. Without the passion, at
        the first sign of hardship, <br>I can see me dropping the business.</p>
    <p>Learning about google ads was cool, and being able to see how many clicks keywords get is definitely going to be
        useful.</p>
    <p>Hearing both sides of the snowboard and chess company was really interesting to me and I am starting to realize
        that business really is personal. And it is risky.</p>
    <p>I am terrified and excited all at the same time to create my own business. It is something that I have thought
        about doing for a while now and have been encouraged to do as well. <br>I definitely want it to be related to
        crafts because that is what I do in my spare time, but I also know there is a lot of competition within the
        products of crafts. <br>I am nervous about the money put into it and I am hoping that it works, but I am excited
        to try it out.</p>
